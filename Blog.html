                    Did you know that an eagle knows when a storm is approaching long before it breaks? The
                    eagle will fly to some high spot and wait for the winds to come. When the storm hits, it sets its
                    wings so that the wind will pick it up and lift it above the storm. While the storm rages below,
                    the eagle is soaring above it. The eagle does not escape the storm. It simply uses the storm to
                    lift it higher. It rises on the winds that bring the storm. When the storms of life come upon us
                    and all of us will experience them â€“ we can rise above them by setting our minds and our belief
                    toward God. The storms do not have to overcome us. We can allow God's power to lift us above
                    them. God enables us to ride the winds of the storm that bring sickness, tragedy, failure and
                    disappointment in our lives. We can soar above the storm. Remember, it is not the burdens of
                     life that weigh us down, it is how we handle them...

                    A professor stood before her Philosophy 101 class and had some items in front of her. When the
                    class began, wordlessly, she picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded
                    to fill it with golf balls. She then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.
                    So the professor picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. She shook the jar
                    lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. She then
                    asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. The professor then picked up a
                    box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. She then
                    asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous - yes. The
                    professor then produced two cans of liquid chocolate from under the table and proceeded to 
                    pour the entire contents into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the sand...

                    Students laughed. "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to recognize
                    that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things - - your family, your
                    spouse, your health, your children, your friends, your favorite passions - - things that if
                    everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. "The pebbles are
                    the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car." "The sand is everything else
                    the small stuff." "If you put the sand into the jar first," she continued, "there is no room for
                    the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and energy
                    on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you...
